title: The new site is here!
---

**Whoopee!** A new site for Code Monkeys is here. Staff and I will continue to set this up and improve on it, but for now just sit tight and wait for the goodness to come. All community server information will be added here, and we'll probably get some better theming on here soon. any suggestions for the site can be told to me in the new **#suggestions** channel in the server *(newcomers click [here](https://discord.gg/QqYtjgf) or use the vanity link [https://discord.me/cm](https://discord.gg/QqYtjgf) to join)*. People who like ideas posted there can upvote with some positive "reaction" emoji. Remember, keep it relevant and useful, and of course, positive.

Oh, and *one* more thing, I will open an **issues** section on the GitHub repository for suggestions and... well, issues... right [here](https://github.com/CMDiscord/cmdiscord.github.io/issues) *(click that)* or go down to the bottom of this page and click the GitHub icon, go into the site repository *(cmdiscord.github.io)*, and you should see an **issues** tab at the top.

*-- spike*
